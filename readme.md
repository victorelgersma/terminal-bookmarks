# Terminal Bookmarks

terminal bookmarks  - the last bookmarking app you'll need. 

## Requirements
- Bash (or zsh)
- grep (standard on Unix-like systems)

## Installation

```sh
brew tap victorelgersma/terminal-bookmarks
brew install bm
```

## Interface

We expose  the commands bm add and get

the syntax of bm add is somewhat similar to git 

```sh
$ bm add 
Usage: bm add <url> -c <description>
```

```sh
$ bm add "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/may/24/children-with-special-needs-in-england-may-lose-legal-right-to-school-support" -c "guardian article which I need for x y z project"
âœ… saved "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/may/24/children-with-special-needs-in-england-may-lose-legal-right-to-school-support" to data/bookmarks.txt
```

if passed without a c flag it will prompt you for a description

```sh 
$ bm add "your  url" 
$ enter descritption
my description here
```

```sh
$ bm get "altitude"

## editing bookmarks

If you really need to edit links or bookmarks you can manually run vim/bookmarks.txt to find the bookmarks you want

## Implementation 

### Adding

adding is done by appending the link and the description on one line to data/bookmarks.txt

A single entry might look like this:

```txt
// data/bookmarks
248:https://www.platform.thgaltitude.com/sites/clrhr6i130023mc01992vyajq/environments/single-tenanted # single tenancy env nutrition
```

### Retrieving

bm is powered by ripgrep and gets translated to rg -i under the hood 

##  Data Store
- a txt file. Not complicated

## Future work

- data portability

bm list just lists all you bookmarks 

```sh
$ bm list

https://outlook.office.com/mail/ # outlook

https://diataxis.fr/ # documentation on documentation

```sh
$ bm import file path/to/bookmarks/file

concatenates the file path/to/bookmarks/file to the existing store of data
```


## Issues

Now that it's a package rather than a repo, it's much harder to edit my bookmarks store. I can think of a few solutions

1. find the place where bookmarks are kept and just use that - issue with this is that it might not be consistent between homebrew installs - but surely that's a YAGNI
2. elaborate data portability work (see above) - maybe that's too complicated though
